    <p class="speech HERMIA"> I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</p>

    <p class="speech THESEUS">Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</p>
    <h2 class="name">HERMIA</h2>
    <p class="speech HERMIA">I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
    I know not by what power I am made bold,
    Nor how it may concern my modesty,
    In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
    But I beseech your grace that I may know
    The worst that may befall me in this case,
    If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>
